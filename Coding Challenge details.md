The dataset consists of 500 customer orders and shows strong overall sales performance with a total revenue of ₹35,065,053. The average order value (₹70,130) is higher than the median (₹55,387.5), indicating a positively skewed distribution caused by a few high-value purchases. A wide range between the minimum (₹685) and maximum (₹2,49,215) order values, along with high variance, highlights significant variation in customer spending behavior. Spending category analysis reveals that a majority of orders (approximately 91%) fall under the high-spending segment, while medium and low spenders contribute a smaller share. City-wise analysis shows higher revenue contribution from Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, and Hyderabad compared to Delhi. Category-wise analysis indicates that groceries have the highest average order value, followed by clothing, electronics, and home appliances. Payment mode analysis further shows that digital payments such as UPI and card transactions are more commonly used than cash, reflecting a preference for cashless transactions among customers.
